## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science and software development. They play a crucial role in optimizing data arrangement in a way that makes searching, insertion, and manipulation more efficient. This repository aims to demonstrate a variety of sorting algorithms, allowing developers to learn, compare, and analyze the efficiency of each algorithm.

## Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are currently implemented:

- [Merge Insertion Sort (Ford-Johnson)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge-insertion_sort)

## Languages

The repository currently provides implementations in:

- C++
- Rust

_(Feel free to contribute implementations in other languages.)_

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zakissimo/Sorting
   ```

2. Choose a programming language and navigate to the corresponding directory.

3. Compile the source code and run the executable:

   For C++:

   ```bash
   make
   ./main
   ```

   For Rust:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   cargo run --release
   ```
